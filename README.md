# Chain of Thought Chat

This is a demonstration of a Chain of Thought (CoT) chat application that employs three agents to apply the CoT paradigm within a Streamlit interface. It is based on the Mixture of Specialized Agent Graphs (MosAG) approach from Holistech, which is designed to implement advanced agent graphs for deep knowledge retrieval and research.

## Web Interface

The Streamlit web interface offers a simple chat window for asking questions, viewing the thought process of the various agents, and saving the entire conversation as a text file.

## Agents
The application utilizes three agents to implement the CoT methodology:

1. **Initial Chain of Thought reasoning agent**: This agent analyzes the userâ€™s question and suggests an initial solution.
2. **Iterative CoT agent**: This agent iteratively refines the first agent's solution until either a satisfactory conclusion is reached or the maximum number of iterations has been performed.
3. **CoT aggregator and explainer**: This agent consolidates the entire conversation and presents the results in a digestible format.

These agents are specified in a YAML configuration file, which includes the necessary language models, system prompts, and user prompts and the maximum number of CoT iterations. This allows for the assignment of a unique LLM to each agent individually within the YAML configuration. Any LLM definition supported by LiteLLM can be used, such as:

- claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
- gpt-4o-mini
- gpt-4o

## Installation

1. Create a virtual Python environment and install all required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file and store your API keys, allowing you to use different language models for testing the CoT approach.
3. Run the Streamlit application, open your browser, and start exploring the CoT approach:

    ```bash
    streamlit run chat.py
    ```
