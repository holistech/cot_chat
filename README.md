# Chain of Thought Chat

This is a demonstration of a Chain of Thought (CoT) chat application that employs three agents to apply the CoT paradigm within a Streamlit interface. It is based on the Mixture of Specialized Agent Graphs (MosAG) approach from Holistech, which is designed to implement advanced agent graphs for deep knowledge retrieval and research.

## Agents
The application utilizes three agents to implement the CoT methodology:

1. **Initial Chain of Thought reasoning agent**: This agent analyzes the userâ€™s question and suggests an initial solution.
2. **Iterative CoT agent**: This agent iteratively refines the first agent's solution until either a satisfactory conclusion is reached or the maximum number of iterations has been performed.
3. **CoT aggregator and explainer**: This agent consolidates the entire conversation and presents the results in a digestible format.

These agents are defined in a YAML configuration file, which includes the required language models, system prompts, and user prompts.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual Python environment and install all required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file and store your API keys, allowing you to use different language models for testing the CoT approach.
3. Run the Streamlit application, open your browser, and start exploring the CoT approach:

    ```bash
    streamlit run chat.py
    ```
